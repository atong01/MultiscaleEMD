Implementation of Multiscale EMD Methods
========================================

Multiscale Earth Mover's Distances embeds the Wasserstein distance between two distributions into $L^1$. For each distribution we build an embedding where the $L^1$ distance between embeddings equivalent to the Earth Mover's Distance between distributions. This creates a geometry between distributions which can be exploited to find EMD-nearest-neighbors in sub-linear time.

We offer two main types of MultiscaleEMDs at the moment:

* DiffusionEMD which embeds the Wasserstein distance between two distributions on a graph approximately into $L^1$ in log-linear time.
* TreeEMD / Trellis which embeds the Wasserstein distance between distributions over a tree exactly into $L^1$. TreeEMD / Trellis also provides utilities for building a tree over data in represented in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ using divisive hierarchical clustering. Where TreeEMD computes the Wasserstein distance, Trellis extends this to the Kantorovich-Rubenstein distance between treatment distribution changes.

Installation
------------

MultiscaleEMD is available in `pypi`. Install by running the following::

    pip install MultiscaleEMD

Quick Start
-----------

MultiscaleEMD is written following the `sklearn` estimator framework.

For DiffusionEMD: We provide two functions that operate quite differently. First the Chebyshev approximation of the operator in `DiffusionCheb`, which we recommend when the number of distributions is small compared to the number of points. Second, the Interpolative Decomposition method that computes dyadic powers of $P^{2^k}$ directly in `DiffusionTree`. These two classes are used in the same way, first supplying parameters, fitting to a graph and array of distributions::

    import numpy as np
    from DiffusionEMD import DiffusionCheb

    # Setup an adjacency matrix and a set of distributions to embed
    adj = np.ones((10, 10))
    distributions = np.random.randn(10, 5)
    dc = DiffusionCheb()

    # Embeddings where the L1 distance approximates the Earth Mover's Distance
    embeddings = dc.fit_transform(adj, distributions)
    # Shape: (5, 60)

For Tree Earth Mover's Distances and Trellis: we provide a number of ways to embed pointcloud data in $\mathbb{R}^d$ into a hierarchical tree. These are implemented as options in the `MetricTree` class.

behave on simple examples that are easy to visualize.
